# Windsurf Agent Tool Usage

## Tool Directory
All tools are located in the "AgentTools" folder.

## How to Use Tools
When given a command like "google...", "run ...", "use tool ...", or "invoke ...", the agent should:
1. Look for the tool in the "AgentTools" folder.
2. Execute the Python script corresponding to the tool name.
3. Pass any required input to the tool interactively or through command-line arguments.

## Available Tools
1. **Google Search Tool**
   - File: `google_search.py`
   - Description: Performs a Google search for the provided query and returns a limited number of results.
   - Example Command:
     ```
     run google_search with query="Python tutorials" and num_results=5
     ```
   - Execution Steps:
     - Prompt the user for `query` (search term).
     - Prompt for `num_results` (default: 5).
     - Output the top results as a list of URLs.

## Notes
- Ensure all tools in "AgentTools" output their results to the console (`stdout`).
- Only Python files with a `main()` function are recognized as callable tools.
- If a tool fails, provide the error message for debugging.
